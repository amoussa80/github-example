 Check out Susan Harris Designs, clothe & accessories store downstairs & a cabin au sucre upstairs selling the best range maple syrups I've come across! She was super helpful too & the syrup is yummy!\par
I really enjoyed there sushi and they are actually renovating as we speak...expect to see lots more goodies in the new year!\par
The $5 arancini is so good! And grab the strawberries while they're still in season!\par
MUST try the Boston Blue Fish sandwich at Buster's Sea Cove. It's delicious and the best I've had and I normally don't like fish. Bit of a line but it's worth the wait. Portions are filling too.\par
Upstairs sees seafood, peameal bacon, mustards, butchers & cheese. Downstairs has coffee, cabbage rolls, truffle salts & dried foods. Don't forget to check event calendar for cooking classes too!\par
A go-to for fresh produce and meat downtown. Mike's Fish Market, Sausage King, Brown Brothers, and Di Liso's are all well worth a visit.\par
Check out Moustachios and try the veal eggplant sandwich with whole made tomato sauce on a Kaiser. Check out Eve's Temptation and try the baklava.\par
They have everything! The pea bacon or something (breaded and fried Canadian bacon) sandwich place is good, as is the European place downstairs with fantastic mushroom caps and latkes.\par
If you're a cheese lover and love stinky, aged cheeses, Olympic Cheese is the place to stop in at...they mark down the older cheeses out front. Guess most Canadians prefer the less-ripened selection.\par
Downstairs, there is lovely chinese food and a nice bakery! Walk to the corner downstairs where there is a RAW shop for nice juices!\par
If you try to Toronto's best sandwich then go for here. It's delicious and the amazing. There are lovely Chinese food and nice bakery. You obviously enjoy excellent food.\par
This popular indoor market offers everything from fruit and artisanal cheese to pastries and fresh flowers. Visit on a Sunday when the North Market building hosts its antique fair.\par
Excellent selection of fancy cheese, meats, fresh pasta and sauces. Most things are quite expensive though, you have to dig for the deals! Try the potato knish!\par
Check out all of the fish mongers to see who has the best quality sushi grade variety. It's always different.\par
If you like markets, that's a great one. You'll find literally everything and most food is km 0. Worth a visit also if visiting the city.\par
Lots of great pastries and fresh seafood. Nice indoor atmosphere. There\rquote s a really good kitchen supplies store and some good vegan options.\par
The veal Parma sandwich at Uno Mustachio is amazing. Very filling and shareable. Get the works with it (except the hot peppers if you like it tame),\par
Two must haves from the market: Tofu vacuum packed and ready to go from the basement and Montreal Style Bagels warm and fresh! I also can't leave here without having a Peameal Bacon Sandwich!\par
Love coming here for food and fruits. Super busy during lunch time. You can find game meat (ex. Boar, kangaroo) at certain meat shops here\par
What is not to love about this place if you like food. Hot bagels, fresh cooked seafood, veal sandwiches, crepes, coffees, and fresh bread\par
Fresh pasta & sauces at St. Lawrence Pizza & Pasta, tasty meals at Buster's Sea Cove and your daytrip here should end up great!\par
Vegans 2! Also find Ying Ying soyfoods on the basement for organic, non- gmo tofu goodness( lots of variety) Next door find fresh growing sprouts and huge salads for lunch.\par
If you haven't been to Buster's Sea Cove on the main floor, you're missing some of the city's best seafood. Try their clam chowder and swordfish sandwich.\par
So much fresh produce, without all the packaging! Seafood & meat in the quantities you want with much more choice than most supermarkets!\par
Vegans! Lots of stuff downstairs!! Cruda Cafe for raw food. Rubes for great variety of beans and rice. Domino for your bulk needs & snacks. St. Law. Organics is superior to the organic stall upstairs\par
Bustling place for great food-make sure to have a good walk around before you decide on one place--there are a lot of good options.\par
It's not like a European food market where you can eat at every food stand, most of the shops sell excellent food to take home and cook.\par
If you have a bunch of things to buy and love good variety and selection...this place is HUGE and has EVERYTHING you could ever shop for (food)\par
Great place for food enthusiasts! It has a wide variety of seasons, meats, vegetables, rices... You name it!\par
I highly reco shopping on a Fri night, after 5pm. Merchants restock to pre for Sat mrng. Bldg is virtually empty which means you get to chat w owners & figure out what's most fresh and in season.\par
Go and eat at Buster's Sea Cove. Try the New England Clam Chowder soup, Lobster roll and Grill Calamari.\par
I'm a vegetarian and I still love this place! The selections of fresh foods are AMAZING. Definitely worth a visit!\par

We can't wait to be back, fresh strawberries in June!!!\par
purple potatoes, rainbow carrots, candy cane beets.. make your dishes a visual delight! there is always something here that is an unexpected colour (which often also comes with an interesting flavour)\par
The gang always serves what's best in season. Just ask if u need to know how to tell if something is ripe or not. If u r using debit get out of the way while it is processing so the line can move.\par
Great area with awesome shops and grocery markets for fresh produce and food finds. Very picturesque with creative and beautiful graffiti walls around this neighborhood.\par
Tony, Linda and the gang always serve whatever 's best in season. Just ask if u need to know how to tell if something is ripe or no\par
Absolutely everything is great here. The best prices in town for fruit and vegetables\par
Great prices on fresh herbs!\par
LOVE this place. Found vegan white chocolate here! They have a wide range of vegan, Eco friendly, bulk and natural products. The male cashier I had was insightful (and adorable) Expensive but worth it\par
you come for the produce and bulk dried goods but will also leave with freshly baked bread, cookies and their velvet-like cashew curry dip.\par
Best place in the downtown core for REAL free range eggs from hens on green grass\par
Try the cafe/deli in the back for a healthy, freshly made snack/meal.\par
Awesome produce.\par
